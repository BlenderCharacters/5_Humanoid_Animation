### 6 Analysing Body Movement: Walking
**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Break down the bodies movements during a walk
2. Focus on the key positions the body will be in during the animation
3. Avoid beginner mistakes

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Be able to break down other similar poses like running
Be comfortable with the 4 main positions in a walk

### 7 Meaningful Markers
**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Add markers to our timeline for reference
2. For a regular animation like walking we will have regularly spaced markers
3. General scaling timeline, dope sheet and graph editor
4. Manipulating our meaningful markers

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Add and rename markers to the timeline
Understand why this is a good practice prior to animating
Comfortable with editing your markers and navigating the timeline, dope sheet and graph editor

### 8 Auto Keying Poses
**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Turning On Auto Keying

2. Learn how to paste that pose as a new keyframe
3. Learn how to paste a mirrored version of that pose

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Students will be able to rapidly assemble their basic animation

### 10 Adding Overlapping Action
**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Look at the hips of our character

Add convincing overlapping action to our walk cycle

### 11 Refining Our Animation
**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Clean up our keyframes
2. Look closely at interpolation between frames
3. Use the graph editor to refine movements

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**
